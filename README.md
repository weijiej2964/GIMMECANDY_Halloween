As part of the Daedalus Honors Scholar Program at Hunter College, we took part in the Halloween Hackathon, where we developed a unique and interactive trick-or-treat game featuring enemies that steal candies from trick-or-treaters. We used Unity and its asset store to create engaging gameplay mechanics, animations, and a dynamic interface, to enhance the overall gaming experience.

### How to play our game:
* You as a trick or treater will be going around houses getting as much candy as you can. You have 5 minutes to do so. Your starting amount will be 20 candies.
* For every candy you get, your score will increase.
* While you‚Äôre trick or treating, avoid monsters that will try to steal your candy.
* The game will be over once the timer is up or when you lose all your candy.
* Use the arrows or WASD keys to move around. Press the key E to interact with the house. 
* Anytime you interact with a house, a dialogue will pop up. Keep pressing E to move onto the next dialogue. They‚Äôre unskippable and you must remain at the house before receive the candy.

### HAVE FUN!!!
