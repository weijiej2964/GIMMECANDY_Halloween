### How to play our game:
* You as a trick or treater will be going around houses getting as much candy as you can. 
* For every candy you get, your score will increase.
* While youâ€™re trick or treating, avoid monsters that will try to steal your candy.
* If you lose all your candy, the game will be over.
* Use the arrows or WASD keys to move around. Press the key E to interact with the house. 
* Anytime you interact with a house, a dialogue will pop up. Click next to move onto the next dialogue. Theyâ€™re unskippable and you must remain at the house before receiving the candy.

HAVE FUN!!!
