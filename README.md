### How to play our game:
* You as a trick or treater will be going around houses getting as much candy as you can. You have 5 minutes to do so.
* For every candy you get, your score will increase.
* While you‚Äôre trick or treating, avoid monsters that will try to steal your candy.
* The game will be over once the timer is up or when you lose all your candy.
* Use the arrows or WASD keys to move around. Press the key E to interact with the house. 
* Anytime you interact with a house, a dialogue will pop up. Click next to move onto the next dialogue. They‚Äôre unskippable and you must remain at the house before receiving the candy.

### HAVE FUN!!!
